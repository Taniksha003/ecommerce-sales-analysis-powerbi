## 📊 Dashboard Analysis & Insights

### 1️⃣ Sales Performance (Time Analysis)
- Monthly revenue trend shows clear seasonality
- Revenue peaks during mid-year months
- Sharp drop observed around September with partial recovery later

**Insight:**  
Sales are seasonal, indicating demand fluctuations or marketing impact during specific periods.

### 2️⃣ Product Category Analysis
- A small number of product categories contribute most of the revenue
- Several categories show low individual contribution

**Insight:**  
Revenue concentration suggests opportunities for category-focused promotions and inventory optimization.

### 3️⃣ Geographic Analysis (Top States by Orders)
- Orders are highly concentrated in a few states
- Top states dominate overall order volume

**Insight:**  
High-performing regions can be prioritized for logistics planning and targeted marketing campaigns.

### 4️⃣ Order Fulfillment Funnel
Order status analyzed across stages:
- Orders Placed  
- Approved

### 5️⃣ Customer Analysis (New vs Returning)
- Majority of customers are one-time buyers
- Returning customers account for approximately **6%**

**Insight:**  
Low customer retention highlights the need for loyalty programs, repeat purchase incentives, and better post-purchase engagement.

### 6️⃣ Price Bucket Analysis
- Most orders fall within lower to mid-price ranges
- Higher price buckets generate fewer orders but higher revenue per order

**Insight:**  
Business operates on a high-volume, low-ticket model with selective high-value purchases.
